This is a mod for the game Distant Worlds 2.

It aims to add more event chains (including content for things like exploration)

Currently, we plan to add a total of 30 event chains, making it an incredibly big mod.

We'll do all of this in 10 phases, with three events for each phase.

Each phase will contain one "big" event chain, consisting of multiple events and decision tree.
